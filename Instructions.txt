Instructions recieved from SOOS:

We need a script that will draw a Mercator projection map of the world’s countries (I can provide a shapefile) with the capacity to add markers to the centroids 
of each of the countries in a list and output the resulting maps as PNGs with easily interpretable names so they’re easy for us to drop into reports. 
As I thought about this overnight, I wondered whether we can make it easier for our future selves by getting you to add a for loop to the start of the script 
so that we can just provide a single spreadsheet with a record for each WG, and in each record, there will be a field with a list of country names 
(see example table below). Then, we can say “for each Working Group, make a map with the countries listed in Field X”. 
The output should be a series of maps with names like RossSea_membermap_202X.png

The only small complication is that these lists may contain duplicates, where there are multiple members from a single country. 
Alyce is looking to see if the SOOS database can strip out the duplicates but if she can’t get rid of them, you might need to deal with them.  
Hopefully, if we’re using opaque markers on the exact centroid of that country, the map will still only get one visible marker for the USA but if it draws oddly, 
then something like unique() might be needed. 

Below is an example of the kind of tablestructure that would be straightforward to pull from our contacts database.                

Working Group	Nations
Ross Sea	UK; USA; France; Australia; NZ; Germany; Japan; USA; Australia; Italy; Korea; China; Australia; Korea; Australia
Amundsen Sea	UK; Sweden; Korea; USA; Japan; France; Australia; Germany; UK; Australia; USA; Italy; Korea; UK; Australia
Data Management Sub-Committee	Australia; NZ; Australia; USA; USA; USA; Germany; UK; Belgium; UK; Italy; Italy; Sweden


The script needs enough documentation (mostly as comments on the script itself) that Alyce and/or I can rerun it as often as needed and make minor tweaks. 
And in the development, I have no doubt that Louise will want to have a bit of input into the visuals of the map – colours and marker styles so that it fits 
the SOOS brand.
